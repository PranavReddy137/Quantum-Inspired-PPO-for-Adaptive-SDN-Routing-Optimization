# Quantum-Inspired-PPO-for-Adaptive-SDN-Routing-Optimization
An end-to-end quantum-inspired PPO traffic shaping system for dynamic network routing in a packet-level NetworkX simulator (latency/bandwidth/loss, queueing, congestion), using complex-valued state encoding + interference-style layers to learn adaptive routing policies under shifting traffic conditions.
